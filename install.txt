Installation of cbPlayer:


1. Upload the unpacked files onto your web-space.

2. Link the CSS and JS. Put the following lines into the head-section of your HTML (meaning between the two <head></head> tags):

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/cbPlayer/cbplayer.css" type="text/css">
    <script type="text/javascript" src="/cbPlayer/cbplayer.js"></script>

3. Include the php:

<?php

  // where cbPlayer resides on your server
  $cbPlayer_dirname = "/cbPlayer";

  // where you have the media files on your server
  $cbPlayer_mediadir = "/content/media";

  // start cbPlayer!
  include("cbPlayer/cbplayer.php");

?>

4. Make sure the paths are correct in the examples above!

5. Upload media files:
   Make sure, you upload every media file with redundant formats:
   audio: .mp3 and .ogg/oga
   video: .mp4 (mpeg/AAC) and .ogg/ogv (theora/vorbis)

   Make sure the filenames match, e.g.:
   Some_Filename_of_outstanding_creativity.mp3
   Some_Filename_of_outstanding_creativity.ogg

6. Now, as you call up the page, where you have included the player, you'll see cbPlayer in action.
